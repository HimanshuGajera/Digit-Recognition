# Digit-Recognition

Digit recognition system identifies a hand-witten digits to respective integer values. This projects uses Tensorflow as backend. Deep learning libraries like Keras and numpy have been used. Opensource MNIST data set is used as raw data.I have created and trained a model to learn and classify hand-witten digits to mathematical numbers with over **96%** accuracy
